This is the final project for Emory University's CS 334: Machine Learning class taught by Dr. Amin Pouriyeh. We are looking at [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset) dataset from Kaggle to build a machine learning model to predict whether a celebrity is attractive based on different features found in their image. The goal is to use this data to better support advertising campaigns; campaigns with more attractive celebrities will be more successful in attracting customers.
